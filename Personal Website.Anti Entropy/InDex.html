<h1>Hello</h1><div id="line"></div>
<p>Piotr Szulczewski (pronounced [ˈpjɔtr ʂulˈt͡ʂɛfskʲi]; born 1981) is a Polish businessman and computer engineer who is the founder and former CEO of the mobile-first ecommerce platform focused on low-cost goods, Wish.com. He is the youngest billionaire from Canada according to Forbes.

    Early life and background
    Szulczewski grew up in the Warsaw neighborhood of Tarchomin.[2] Upon the collapse of the communism in Poland, his parents emigrated to Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, about 70 miles (110 km) west of Toronto. He studied mathematics and computer science at the University of Waterloo, where he met Danny Zhang.[3]
    
    Just before graduating from the University of Waterloo in 2004 at the age of 23, Szulczewski relocated to Palo Alto, California and commenced a four-month internship coding for Google. He then became a full-time employee for Google, where he wrote the prototype algorithms for keyword expansion, a feature which aids in searching for products from advertisers.[3]</p>
